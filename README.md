## Setup
I am afraid the app is not self-hosted at the moment of writing this readme (but will be in the near future!).

To launch it you need to have python3 installed, I recommend at least 3.12
After you cd into the project directory simply perform `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all python dependencies. 
After installing dependencies simply run the main.py. This will launch the whole application along with the sqlite database.

## How is it better from free task managing apps?
Well... it's not. Maybe will be in the future after some heavy work on the frontend, but that's not the point.

I wanted to build complete full-stack app myself and that is the main reason this project was created. If it ever becomes better than other FREE options then amazing. 
If it does not, then it doesn't matter - I still learned a ton and that was the point.
